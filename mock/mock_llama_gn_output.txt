You begin the afternoon at 맨션나인, taking in the latest exhibition as the bustle of Gangnam fades away. The art sparks lively conversation and a sense of adventure.

A few steps underground leads you to 팜팜, a themed cafe full of retro games and bright lights. Laughter rises as you compete over vintage joysticks.

Nearby, 감성타코 강남역점 serves up bold flavors for lunch. You savor each bite and then rent bikes to explore the busy streets from a new perspective.

The day winds down at 빽다방 강남역지하도점 with cool drinks and a quiet chat. Before heading out you buy tickets to a pop-up show for another day together.

As evening settles over Gangnam, you both feel energized, ready for whatever comes next.
