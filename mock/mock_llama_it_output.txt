The outing begins at 해마아트스페이스, where quiet halls display contemporary pieces that spark thoughtful smiles. The calm sets the pace for the day.

Just around the corner you find 히트커피로스터스 이태원. Over fragrant brews you sketch a caricature of each other, giggling at the playful results.

Next comes 안다미로 식물카페, lush with greenery and sunlight. A small art workshop invites you to craft keepsakes that match the tranquil mood.

Finally you swing by 라이온프라이드, a vibrant themed cafe. A short stroll afterward takes you to the river for a gentle paddle boat ride.

Evening falls softly over Itaewon, leaving the two of you refreshed and closer than before.
