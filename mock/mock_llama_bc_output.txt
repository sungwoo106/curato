At noon you step into 그라운드시소 서촌, wandering through playful exhibits that invite you to see the city anew. The energy warms you both, setting the tone for the day.

Lunch awaits at 아뜰리에 안단테. Over a savory meal you share a mini dessert platter, sweet bites that linger like the soft music in the background.

In the afternoon you discover 가진화랑, a quirky themed cafe. Amid its artful displays, you pick up a pair of matching keychains to remember the outing.

As the sun lowers you settle at 씨엘로 for a quiet coffee. From there a short stroll leads to a small river cruise, gentle waves carrying you toward evening.

Hand in hand, you wander back through Bukchon’s hushed streets, the history around you whispering promises of more adventures together.
