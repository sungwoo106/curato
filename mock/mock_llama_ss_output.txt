You meet up near 다이닝야경 성수점, the promise of city views fueling your anticipation. From the rooftop you watch the skyline before heading out.

At 에스팩토리 you explore an eclectic exhibition, wandering between installations with curious excitement. The industrial vibe adds a cool contrast to your day.

A craving leads you to 아비시니카 성수점 for artisanal coffee and a shared mini dessert. Afterwards you rent bikes for a leisurely ride through the neighborhood.

The tour concludes at 성수미술관, where quiet galleries draw you into whispered conversation. A final look at the lights of Seongsu wraps the outing in gentle wonder.

The streets glow as you say farewell, both of you inspired by this creative corner of the city.
